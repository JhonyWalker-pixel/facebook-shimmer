## :clipboard: About the project

I was working on facebook and I came across a simple but very interesting effect, when scrolling the feed that loads constantly to remain infinite it has a brief animation of a brightness that sometimes loads so fast that you can't even notice it, however I decided to recreate this effect.

## :computer: Used language

The cool thing is that this project only used CSS.
